# Geospatial Data Structures & Algorithms

In spatial data science, and more generally in the computational sciences, we fundamentally must deal with abstractions and representaions of real-world phenomena. The predominant abstractions we use are features and layers, but even these are abstractions of several core fundamental data structures and algorithms that we use to perform computational geometry. These examples will show basic data structures and algorithms and well as geometric data structures and algorithms that are commonly used on spatial data.
